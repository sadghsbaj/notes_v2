# Import and export documents with Tiptap

Available in Start planBeta

The Tiptap Conversion Service makes it easy to import and export content between Tiptap and document file formats. It offers:

-   **Import**: Convert files (Word DOCX, OpenOffice/LibreOffice ODT, or Markdown files) into Tiptap’s JSON document format.
-   **Export**: Turn Tiptap JSON back into Word DOCX, OpenOffice/LibreOffice ODT, or Markdown files.
-   **Editor Extensions**: Use built-in Tiptap Pro extensions to import/export directly within a Tiptap editor instance.
-   **REST API**: Use HTTP endpoints to integrate our conversion services anywhere needed without a Tiptap editor being required.

### Conversion service

We are continuously improving the conversion service. Support for page breaks, headers/footers, references like footnotes, and other complex features are in active development.
