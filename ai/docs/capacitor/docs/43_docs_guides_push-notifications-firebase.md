# Using Push Notifications with Firebase in an Ionic + Angular App

**Web Framework**: Angular **Platforms**: iOS, Android

One of the most common features provided by application developers to their users is push notifications. In this tutorial, we'll walk through all the steps needed to get [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) working on iOS and Android.

For the purposes of registering and monitoring for push notifications from Firebase, we'll make use of the [Push Notification API for Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/push-notifications) in an Ionic + Angular application.

## Required Dependencies[​](#required-dependencies "Direct link to Required Dependencies")

Building and deploying iOS and Android applications using Capacitor requires a bit of setup. Please [follow the instructions to install the necessary Capacitor dependencies here](/docs/getting-started/environment-setup) before continuing.

To test push notifications on iOS, Apple requires that you have [a paid Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/).

Also, we're using Firebase for push notifications, so if you're using other Cordova plugins that use the Firebase SDK make sure they're using the latest versions.

## Prepare an Ionic Capacitor App[​](#prepare-an-ionic-capacitor-app "Direct link to Prepare an Ionic Capacitor App")

If you have an existing Ionic app, skip this section. If not, let's create an Ionic app first.

In your preferred terminal, install the latest version of the Ionic CLI:

```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

Next, let's use the CLI to create a new Ionic Angular app based on the **blank** starter project and call it **capApp**:

```
ionic start capApp blank --type=angular
```

Once the application has been created successfully, switch to the newly created project directory:

```
cd capApp/
```

Finish up by editing the `appId` in `capacitor.config.ts`.

```
const config: CapacitorConfig = {- appId: 'io.ionic.starter',+ appId: 'com.mydomain.myappnam',  appName: 'capApp',  webDir: 'www'};
```

## Building the App & Adding Platforms[​](#building-the-app--adding-platforms "Direct link to Building the App & Adding Platforms")

Before adding any native platforms to this project, the app must be built at least once. A web build creates the web assets directory that Capacitor needs (`www` folder in Ionic Angular projects).

```
ionic build
```

Next, let's add the iOS and Android platforms to our app.

```
ionic cap add iosionic cap add android
```

Upon running these commands, both `android` and `ios` folders at the root of the project are created. These are entirely separate native project artifacts that should be considered part of your Ionic app (i.e., check them into source control).

## Using the Capacitor Push Notification API[​](#using-the-capacitor-push-notification-api "Direct link to Using the Capacitor Push Notification API")

First of all, we need to install the Capacitor Push Notifications Plugin

```
npm install @capacitor/push-notificationsnpx cap sync
```

Then, before we get to Firebase, we'll need to ensure that our application can register for push notifications by making use of the Capacitor Push Notification API. We'll also add an `alert` (you could use `console.log` statements instead) to show us the payload for a notification when it arrives and the app is open on our device.

In your app, head to the `home.page.ts` file and add an `import` statement and a `const` to make use of the Capacitor Push API:

```
import {  ActionPerformed,  PushNotificationSchema,  PushNotifications,  Token,} from '@capacitor/push-notifications';
```

Then, add the `ngOnInit()` method with some API methods to register and monitor for push notifications. We will also add an `alert()` a few of the events to monitor what is happening:

```
export class HomePage implements OnInit {  ngOnInit() {    console.log('Initializing HomePage');    // Request permission to use push notifications    // iOS will prompt user and return if they granted permission or not    // Android will just grant without prompting    PushNotifications.requestPermissions().then(result => {      if (result.receive === 'granted') {        // Register with Apple / Google to receive push via APNS/FCM        PushNotifications.register();      } else {        // Show some error      }    });    // On success, we should be able to receive notifications    PushNotifications.addListener('registration',      (token: Token) => {        alert('Push registration success, token: ' + token.value);      }    );    // Some issue with our setup and push will not work    PushNotifications.addListener('registrationError',      (error: any) => {        alert('Error on registration: ' + JSON.stringify(error));      }    );    // Show us the notification payload if the app is open on our device    PushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationReceived',      (notification: PushNotificationSchema) => {        alert('Push received: ' + JSON.stringify(notification));      }    );    // Method called when tapping on a notification    PushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationActionPerformed',      (notification: ActionPerformed) => {        alert('Push action performed: ' + JSON.stringify(notification));      }    );  }}
```

Here is the full implementation of `home.page.ts`:

```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';import {  ActionPerformed,  PushNotificationSchema,  PushNotifications,  Token,} from '@capacitor/push-notifications';@Component({  selector: 'app-home',  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],})export class HomePage implements OnInit {  ngOnInit() {    console.log('Initializing HomePage');    // Request permission to use push notifications    // iOS will prompt user and return if they granted permission or not    // Android will just grant without prompting    PushNotifications.requestPermissions().then(result => {      if (result.receive === 'granted') {        // Register with Apple / Google to receive push via APNS/FCM        PushNotifications.register();      } else {        // Show some error      }    });    PushNotifications.addListener('registration', (token: Token) => {      alert('Push registration success, token: ' + token.value);    });    PushNotifications.addListener('registrationError', (error: any) => {      alert('Error on registration: ' + JSON.stringify(error));    });    PushNotifications.addListener(      'pushNotificationReceived',      (notification: PushNotificationSchema) => {        alert('Push received: ' + JSON.stringify(notification));      },    );    PushNotifications.addListener(      'pushNotificationActionPerformed',      (notification: ActionPerformed) => {        alert('Push action performed: ' + JSON.stringify(notification));      },    );  }}
```

After this, you'll want to generate a new build and let Capacitor know about the changes. You can do that with:

```
ionic buildnpx cap copy
```

## Creating a Project for your App on Firebase[​](#creating-a-project-for-your-app-on-firebase "Direct link to Creating a Project for your App on Firebase")

Before we can connect Firebase Cloud Messaging to your application and send push notifications, you'll need to start a project in Firebase.

Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click the **Add project** button.

Name the project, accept the Firebase ToS and click **Create project** to continue. A Project ID should be automatically generated for you.

## Android[​](#android "Direct link to Android")

### Integrating Firebase with the Android app[​](#integrating-firebase-with-the-android-app "Direct link to Integrating Firebase with the Android app")

This section more-or-less mirrors the [setting up Firebase using the Firebase console documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0). See below for specific Capacitor-related notes.

Go to the Project Overview page for your Firebase project and at the top, click on the **Android** icon to add a new android application.

![Add new Android Application in Firebase Console](/docs/assets/images/add-android-app-c17df2d6236a3b2be108b9cf1d3c3f31.png)

The next screen will ask you for some information about your application.

-   Your **Android package name** should match the **appId** from your `capacitor.config.ts` file
-   We used `com.mydomain.myappname` for this Capacitor app ID, so that is what we'll use for this entry.
-   Nickname and Debug Signing Certificate are optional

Then click the **Register app** button.

### Download and Use the `google-services.json` file[​](#download-and-use-the-google-servicesjson-file "Direct link to download-and-use-the-google-servicesjson-file")

The next prompt will ask you to download a `google-services.json` file. This file contains the information your Capacitor app needs to connect to Firebase from Android.

Download the `google-services.json` file to your local machine. Then move the file into your Capacitor Android project directory, specifically under `android/app/`.

![Google Services JSON Location for Android](/docs/assets/images/google-services-location-android-1b89340513696453eb62085eef9b40d8.png)

We don't need to _add_ any dependencies to our project because `@capacitor/push-notifications` automatically include a version of `firebase-messaging` in it's `build.gradle` file.

## iOS[​](#ios "Direct link to iOS")

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

iOS push notifications are significantly more complicated to set up than Android. You must have a [paid Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/) _and_ take care of the following items prior to being able to test push notifications with your iOS application:

1.  [Setup the proper Development or Production certificates & provisioning profiles](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev60b6fbbc7) for your iOS application in the Apple Developer Portal
2.  [Create an APNS certificate or key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns) for either Development or Production in the Apple Developer Portal
3.  [Ensure Push Notification capabilities have been enabled](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev88ff319e7) in your application in Xcode

### Integrating Firebase with our native iOS app[​](#integrating-firebase-with-our-native-ios-app "Direct link to Integrating Firebase with our native iOS app")

This part is very similar to the Android section above, with a few key differences.

First, go to the **Project Overview** page for your Firebase project. If you've been following this guide, you'll already have an Android application listed at the top of the page.

To add iOS to your Firebase project, click the **Add App** button and select the **iOS** platform.

The next screen will ask you for some information about your application.

-   Your **iOS bundle ID** should match the **appId** from your `capacitor.config.ts` file
-   We used `com.mydomain.myappname` for this Capacitor app ID, so that is what we'll use for this entry.
-   App Nickname and App Store ID are optional

Then click the **Register app** button.

### Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to your iOS app[​](#add-the-googleservice-infoplist-file-to-your-ios-app "Direct link to add-the-googleservice-infoplist-file-to-your-ios-app")

_Note: This is **not** the same file used for your Android app._

Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` provided to your local machine.

You'll then want to open Xcode...

```
npx cap open ios
```

... and move the `.plist` file into your Xcode project as instructed by Firebase, ensuring to add it to all targets.

![Google Service Info Plist Location for iOS](/docs/assets/images/google-plist-location-ios-d809634deabea911f5370c9a861052d5.png)

### Add the Firebase SDK[​](#add-the-firebase-sdk "Direct link to Add the Firebase SDK")

The Push Notification API on iOS makes use of either Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods for dependency management. We need to tell them to make use of Firebase.

#### Using Swift Package Manager (SPM)[​](#using-swift-package-manager-spm "Direct link to Using Swift Package Manager (SPM)")

To add the SDK using SPM, you'll need to make a modification to your `ios/App/App.xcodeproj`

First, open `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` in Xcode by running `npx cap open ios` or double click the file in finder.

Select your App on the left side and select package dependencies on the right, as shown below.

![SPM-FB-Step1](/docs/assets/images/firebase-spm-step1-e8cf911cd1dbcf76f0893ff2014d9d27.png)

Then, select the plus icon to add a new package, something like the below should be shown.

![SPM-FB-Step2a](/docs/assets/images/firebase-spm-step2a-ab60ba3ad432e983f1a8de77f9af328c.png)

In the search box, enter `https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk`, then select "Add Package."

![SPM-FB-Step2b](/docs/assets/images/firebase-spm-step2b-a88c623074087a9aa42cc86188da941a.png)

Now scroll and add Firebase Messaging to the App target.

![SPM-FB-Step3](/docs/assets/images/firebase-spm-step3-281ea4a64f1a5b99a0d7b986432640c3.png)

Click "Add Package", and wait for processing to finish. When it has you should see something similar to this image.

![SPM-FB-Step4](/docs/assets/images/firebase-spm-step4-12e6ff028b90c3f376503b7c194c718b.png)

#### Using CocoaPods[​](#using-cocoapods "Direct link to Using CocoaPods")

To do this, we need to modify the `Podfile`, which can be found in Xcode under `Pods`:

![Podfile Location iOS](/docs/assets/images/podfile-location-ios-342b27c94af4ddc839e7e3caa85482fb.png)

We need to add Firebase to the CocoaPods provided for our App target. To do that, add `pod FirebaseMessaging` to your `target 'App'` section, like so:

```
target 'App' do  capacitor_pods  # Add your Pods here  pod 'FirebaseMessaging' # Add this lineend
```

Your `Podfile` should look something like this:

```
require_relative '../../node_modules/@capacitor/ios/scripts/pods_helpers'platform :ios, '14.0'use_frameworks!# workaround to avoid Xcode caching of Pods that requires# Product -> Clean Build Folder after new Cordova plugins installed# Requires CocoaPods 1.6 or newerinstall! 'cocoapods', :disable_input_output_paths => truedef capacitor_pods  pod 'Capacitor', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/ios'  pod 'CapacitorCordova', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/ios'  pod 'CapacitorApp', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/app'  pod 'CapacitorHaptics', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/haptics'  pod 'CapacitorKeyboard', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/keyboard'  pod 'CapacitorPushNotifications', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/push-notifications'  pod 'CapacitorStatusBar', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/status-bar'endtarget 'App' do  capacitor_pods  # Add your Pods here  pod 'FirebaseMessaging'endpost_install do |installer|  assertDeploymentTarget(installer)end
```

### Update the Project[​](#update-the-project "Direct link to Update the Project")

Now we'll need to ensure that our iOS project is updated with the proper Firebase CocoaPod installed.

_Note: This part can take a while as CocoaPods needs to download all the appropriate files/dependencies._

```
npx cap update ios
```

### Add Initialization Code[​](#add-initialization-code "Direct link to Add Initialization Code")

To connect to Firebase when your iOS app starts up, you need to add the following to your `AppDelegate.swift` file.

First, add an `import` at the top of the file:

```
import FirebaseCoreimport FirebaseMessaging
```

... and then add the configuration method for Firebase to initialization code to your `AppDelegate.swift` file, in the `application(didFinishLaunchingWithOptions)` method.

```
FirebaseApp.configure()
```

Then you need to add the following two methods to correctly handle the push registration events:

```
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {  Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken  Messaging.messaging().token(completion: { (token, error) in    if let error = error {        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorDidFailToRegisterForRemoteNotifications, object: error)    } else if let token = token {        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorDidRegisterForRemoteNotifications, object: token)    }  })}func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {  NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorDidFailToRegisterForRemoteNotifications, object: error)}
```

Your completed `AppDelegate.swift` file should look something like this:

```
import UIKitimport Capacitorimport FirebaseCoreimport FirebaseMessaging@UIApplicationMainclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {  var window: UIWindow?  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {    // Override point for customization after application launch.    FirebaseApp.configure()    return true  }  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {    Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken    Messaging.messaging().token(completion: { (token, error) in      if let error = error {          NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorDidFailToRegisterForRemoteNotifications, object: error)      } else if let token = token {          NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorDidRegisterForRemoteNotifications, object: token)      }    })  }  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {    NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorDidFailToRegisterForRemoteNotifications, object: error)  }
```

### Upload the APNS Certificate or Key to Firebase[​](#upload-the-apns-certificate-or-key-to-firebase "Direct link to Upload the APNS Certificate or Key to Firebase")

If you followed the instructions from the beginning, you'll have created an Apple APNS Certificate or an APNS Auth Key in the Apple Developer portal. You need to upload one of these to Firebase before Firebase can talk to APNS and send push notifications to your application.

To upload your certificate or auth key, from the **Project Overview** page:

1.  Click on your iOS application and then the **Settings** gear icon.
2.  On the Settings page, click on the **Cloud Messaging** tab.
3.  Under the **iOS app configuration** header, upload your Auth Key or Certificate(s) using the provided **Upload** button.

## Sending a Test Notification[​](#sending-a-test-notification "Direct link to Sending a Test Notification")

Now for the fun part - let's verify that push notifications from Firebase are working on Android and iOS!

We need to fire up our application on Android or iOS so that our `home.page.ts` page can register and receive notifications.

To open your Android project in Android Studio:

```
npx cap open android
```

To open your iOS project in Xcode:

```
npx cap open ios
```

Once the project is open, side-load the application on your device using the Run feature of either Android Studio or Xcode. The app should start up on the home page.

_Note: On iOS, you will see a popup asking you to allow notifications for your app - make sure you choose to **Allow notifications**!_

If your app successfully registers and you followed the code above, you should see an alert with a success message!

Now we'll test to see if the notifications are received by our device. To send a notification, in Firebase, go to the **Cloud Messaging** section under the Grow header in the project pane.

Next, select the **New Notification** button.

When creating the notification, you only need to specify the following information:

1.  The text of the notification
2.  The title (Android only, optional for iOS)
3.  The Target (either a user segment or topic; I recommend just targeting the iOS or Android app itself, see below)

![Change Push Target Firebase](/docs/assets/images/change-push-target-firebase-fcd4851d0716121318029525fbeca756.png)

4.  The Scheduling (leave this to "Now")

At that point, you can **Review** the notification you've put together and select **Publish** to send the notification out.

If you've setup your application correctly, you'll see an alert pop up on your home screen with the push notification you composed in Firebase. You can then tap on the notification and you should get an `alert` for the `pushActionPerformed` event, per our code above.

![Push Test Android](/docs/assets/images/push-test-android-bee5cea6dd0fe55a58c8d488cff3b508.png)

![Push Test iOS](/docs/assets/images/push-test-ios-9f7ef3395af988b2aaa7cdba862680fd.png)

## Images in Push Notifications[​](#images-in-push-notifications "Direct link to Images in Push Notifications")

You can optionally include Images as part of push notification by following the guide below.

tip

The Firebase Messaging SDK can include an `ImageUrl` property as part of its payload and will display it. The url must be `https://` and be sized under 300kb.

### Images with Android[​](#images-with-android "Direct link to Images with Android")

Android will automatically display images when using `@capacitor/push-notifications`. If you test this in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) by setting `Notification image` the push notification will appear on the Android device similar to the screenshot below:

![Push Notification with Image for Android](/docs/assets/images/android-push-image-daf08e2ba33502bc7f6d1b2a93c280f3.jpeg)

### Images with iOS[​](#images-with-ios "Direct link to Images with iOS")

iOS requires a [Notification Service Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension) to be added to your project in order to display images in push notifications.

In XCode:

-   Click `File` > `New` > `Target`
-   Choose `Notification Service Extension` and click `Next`
-   Enter a `Product Name` (for example `pushextension`)
-   Select your Team
-   Click `Finish`
-   When asked click `Activate`

Choose `pushextension` from the list of Targets then:

-   Click `Signing & Capabilities`
-   Click `+ Capability`
-   Choose `Push Notifications`
-   Change the Deployment target from `iOS 16.4` (or whatever Xcode chose) to `iOS 15.0`

note

If you do not change the deployment target for your extension then images will not appear on devices on an older version of iOS.

To add Firebase Messaging to the extension open your `Podfile` and add:

```
target 'pushextension' do  pod 'FirebaseMessaging'end
```

Then update Cocoapods by running:

```
npx cap update ios
```

Now open `NotificationService.swift` (it will be in the folder named `pushextension`) and replace the contents with the following:

```
import UserNotificationsimport FirebaseMessagingclass NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension {    var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)?    var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent?    override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {        guard let content = request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent else { return }        self.contentHandler = contentHandler        self.bestAttemptContent = content                FIRMessagingExtensionHelper().populateNotificationContent(content, withContentHandler: contentHandler)    }        override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() {        guard let contentHandler = contentHandler,              let bestAttemptContent =  bestAttemptContent else { return }                contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)    }}
```

You should now test a push notification from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) remembering to set the `Notification image` and choose your iOS app. When it arrives on the iOS device it will appear on the right hand side as shown below:
