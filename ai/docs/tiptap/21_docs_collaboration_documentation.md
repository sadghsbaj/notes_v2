# Manage Documents with Tiptap

Collaboration Documents form the backbone of Tiptap Collaboration, storing everything from content and comments to versions and metadata using the Yjs format.

Typically, users manage these documents using the REST API or track changes with the Collaboration Webhook, which sends detailed updates. Tiptap converts the documents into HTML or JSON for you, so you don't have to deal directly with the Yjs format.

-   **Host your documents:** Choose between cloud, dedicated cloud or on-premises deployment.
-   **Document REST API:** Create, update, and delete documents programmatically.
-   **Webhooks:** Automate responses to real-time document and comment events.
-   **Document versioning and comparison:** Track changes in documents through automatic or manual versioning, and visually compare differences between snapshots.
-   **Content injection:** Modify document content server-side with the REST API, even during active collaboration sessions.

## Enterprise on-premises solution

## [](#integrate-documents)Integrate documents

Integrating documents into your editor and application with Tiptap is straightforward. By adding the Tiptap Collaboration provider to your setup, documents are automatically stored and managed within the Tiptap Collaboration framework.

This integration immediately enables you to use all document features, like storing collaborative documents, managing version histories, using the REST API, and injecting content.

### Note

You can easily migrate your documents from our cloud to an on-premises server at a later time.

1.  **Integrate the Tiptap Editor:** Follow the [installation guide](/docs/collaboration/getting-started/install) to setup an editor.
2.  **Activate a plan:** Begin a [free trial or choose a subscription](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/billing).
3.  **Add an environment.** On your [Dashboard](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/), click the »Add environment« button, enter a name and pick the region that is closest to your users.
4.  **Check the configuration.** As soon as you save the environment, your app boots up. Visit the [configuration page](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/configuration/document-server) to copy your AppID, API keys, and other connection details.

And now, you are all set to use the document features.

## [](#retrieve-and-manage-documents)Retrieve and manage documents

Use the [REST API](/docs/collaboration/documents/rest-api) to fetch documents in `JSON` or `HTML` format for easy integration with your system. For immediate updates on changes, configure [webhooks](/docs/collaboration/core-concepts/webhooks) to receive real-time notifications.

**Track changes in documents:** The [Snapshot](/docs/collaboration/documents/snapshot) extension in Tiptap Collaboration automatically captures and stores snapshots of documents at designated intervals. It also allows for manual versioning, enabling users to track detailed changes and document evolution.

**Compare snapshots:** The [compare snapshots](/docs/collaboration/documents/snapshot-compare) extension lets you visually compare two versions of a document, highlighting changes and their authors, helping you see modifications over time.

**Inject content:** Update the content of active documents with an [Patch Document endpoint](/docs/collaboration/documents/content-injection), which allows server-side modifications even during active user collaboration.
