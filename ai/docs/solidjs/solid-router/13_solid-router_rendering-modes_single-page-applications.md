Rendering modes

# Single page applications

[Edit this page](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs/edit/main/src/routes/solid-router/rendering-modes/spa.mdx)

When deploying applications that use a client-side router without relying on Server-Side Rendering, it is important that redirects to the index page are handled properly. This prevents the CDN or hosting service from returning a "not found" error when accessing URLs that do not correspond to files.

Each provider has a different way of doing this. For example, Netlify provides a `_redirects` file that contains:

```
/*   /index.html   200
```

Vercel, on the other hand, requires a rewrites section in your `vercel.json`:

```
{  "rewrites": [    {      "source": "/(.*)",      "destination": "/index.html"    }  ]}
```
