# @capacitor/haptics

The Haptics API provides physical feedback to the user through touch or vibration.

On devices that don't have Taptic Engine or Vibrator, the API calls will resolve without performing any action.

## Install[​](#install "Direct link to Install")

```
npm install @capacitor/hapticsnpx cap sync
```

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

```
import { Haptics, ImpactStyle } from '@capacitor/haptics';const hapticsImpactMedium = async () => {  await Haptics.impact({ style: ImpactStyle.Medium });};const hapticsImpactLight = async () => {  await Haptics.impact({ style: ImpactStyle.Light });};const hapticsVibrate = async () => {  await Haptics.vibrate();};const hapticsSelectionStart = async () => {  await Haptics.selectionStart();};const hapticsSelectionChanged = async () => {  await Haptics.selectionChanged();};const hapticsSelectionEnd = async () => {  await Haptics.selectionEnd();};
