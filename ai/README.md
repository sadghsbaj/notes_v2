# notes_v2 – AI Context

Start here when onboarding to this project.

## Essential Reading (in order)

### 1. Project Context
Read all files in `01_project/`:
- `01_vision.md` – What this app is, goals, constraints
- `02_techstack.md` – Stack decisions (Solid, Vanilla Extract, etc.)
- `03_milestones.md` – Current phase and timeline

### 2. Standards
Read all files in `02_standards/`:
- `code-style.md` – TypeScript, naming, structure rules
- `ui-ux.md` – Design system, colors, typography
- `testing.md` – Testing strategy

### 3. Specs Overview
Read `03_specs/README.md` for an overview of feature specs.  
**Do NOT read all specs** – only dive into specific specs when working on that feature.

## Current Work

**`TODO.md`** contains the active task list. Check this for what to work on.

## Reference Docs

`docs/` contains external library documentation (SolidJS, Vanilla Extract, Capacitor, Tiptap).  
Search here when you need API details.
